# Geologic History of Earth

## Project Description

A brief summary of the Earth's geologic history. Shows the structure of the geologic time scale in a simple interactive way. Gives a basic understanding of the key features and events that characterize each time interval.

* The core idea is to display the Earth's geologic history in a way that is both informative and visually enjoyable, providing a meaningful overview without going into too much detail.

* Nested collapsible blocks offer a compact and intuitive layout for viewing and navigating the timeline structure, also making it easier to remember.
    
* The timeline can be displayed in either direction: chronologically (starting from the formation of the planet) or inversely (diving from the present into older periods and epochs).
    
* There is a quick navigation panel on the right that allows the user to jump to any specific timeline division with a single click.
    
* The site utilizes Angular components recursively. This approach allows to display a fairly large structure with relatively little code.
